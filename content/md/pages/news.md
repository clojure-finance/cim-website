S&P 500 ended higher over the week driven by upside earning surprise despite disappointing economic data.

There was also a surprising jump in weekly jobless claims to 258,000, the highest level in 14 months.
Long-term bond yields also rose in the wake of the inflation data, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note hitting its highest intraday level (4.12%) since July 31. The investment-grade corporate bond market remained also mostly oversubscribed.

The People’s Bank of China initiated a swap facility worth RMB 500 billion to inject liquidity into institutional investors for stock purchases. This program allows nonbank financial entities like securities firms, funds, and insurers to access highly liquid assets such as government bonds and central bank bills by providing specific collateral. This move was a part of an extensive stimulus plan unveiled by the central bank in late September, which encompassed interest rate reductions and other strategies aimed at revitalizing China’s economy.
Spending by Chinese consumers during the recent extended holiday fell short of pre-pandemic levels. Official data revealed a 5.9% rise in passenger traffic and a 6.3% increase in spending compared to the previous year. Box office earnings stood at RMB 2.1 billion, a decline from RMB 2.7 billion recorded a year ago. Nevertheless, the average daily expenditure per trip rose to about RMB 131, up from RMB 113 during the five-day Labor Day break in May.

### US
Over the week, S&P 500 moved to record highs, as investors appeared to celebrate new stimulus measures in China. Sector-wise, Chemicals and materials stocks were particularly strong on hopes for a rebound in Chinese demand. Copper prices also increased, raising hopes that “Doctor Copper” was again reflecting a healthier global industrial economy. Technology stocks outperformed as well, helped by reports of a possible takeover of Intel and news that NVIDIA’s CEO had ceased sales of his own shares in the company. In addition, chipmaker Micron Technology surged and seemed to provide a general tailwind for the sector following its upbeat outlook for AI demand.
Data-wise, Consumer confidence on Tue fell to 98.7, largely missed consenus of 103.9. New home sales on Wed declined 4.7% in August while building permits data were revised lower. PCE on Fri rose only 0.1% in August, a tick below expectations. On a yoy basis, the index climbed only 2.2%, close to the Fed’s 2.0% long-term inflation target and the least since February 2021, suggesting a moderation in inflationary pressures.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note ended little changed for the week.

### China
Chinese stocks surged after Beijing unveiled a slew of measures to shore up the economy. The Shanghai Composite Index climbed 12.8%, while the blue chip CSI 300 soared 15.7%. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index gained 13%.
PBOC cut its RRR by 50 basis points, and reduced its seven-day reverse repo rate by 20 basis points to 1.5%. It cut the MLF rate by 30 basis points to 2%, marking the largest-ever cut to the monetary policy tool since 2016. The moves were part of a sweeping stimulus package announced last Tuesday at a rare press conference by PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng that aims to jumpstart China’s ailing economy. Other measures unveiled by the PBOC included a rate cut for existing home mortgages and slashing the nationwide down payment ratio for second home purchases to 15% from 25%.

### Japan
Japan’s stock markets gained over the week, with the Nikkei 225 Index rising 5.6% and the broader TOPIX Index up 3.7%. The latest commentary from the Bank of Japan (BoJ), perceived as dovish, weighed on the yen, providing a favorable backdrop. Optimism also came from China’s stimulus announcements, especially for the exports to China.
The new Prime Minister was elected to be Shigeru Ishiba on Fri, who has been critical of the Bank of Japan’s easy policies in the past. However, he sounded more conciliatory over the weekend saying monetary policy “must remain accommodative” given the state of the economy. That helped the dollar bounce 0.5% to 142.85 yen, after sliding 1.8% on Friday from a 146.49 top.
Interest rate - BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda said that the central bank has enough time to assess market and economic developments before adjusting monetary policy again—suggesting that it is in no rush to raise rates further.

### US
The large-cap indexes moved to record highs as investors celebrated the kickoff of the rate-cutting cycle by a 50 bps cut on Thursday morning. The rally was also relatively broad, with the smaller-cap indexes outperforming, although they remained below previous peaks—the small-cap Russell 2000 Index, in particular, ended the week roughly 9% below the all-time high it established in November 2021.
The rally is accompanied by good consumer data that ease recession fears. Retail sales on Tue had risen 0.1%, which was more than expected and which followed an upwardly revised jump of 1.1% in July. The downside surprise on jobless claims on Thu provided more evidence for supporting the consumer in good shape. The housing sector also improved by a 4.9% rise in housing permits of August on Wed, although sales of existing homes had unexpectedly fallen 2.5%.
## Credits
10 year treasury yield rose. Spreads in the investment-grade corporate bond market tightened throughout the week as higher rates spurred demand early in the week. Issuance occurred early in the week, before the Fed’s policy meeting, and was, on average, oversubscribed.
## Single stock
INTC ended the week with an announcement of a potential acquisition with Qualcomm which helped pushed the stock up 11% for the week.

### CN/HK
Chinese equities rose in a holiday-shortened week as the Fed’s decision to cut interest rates offset a batch of disappointing economic data. The Shanghai Composite Index gained 1.21%, while the blue chip CSI 300 added 1.32%.
Disappointing foreign direct investment flows on Friday were down 31.5% on the same period last year, the biggest fall since January 2009. Industrial production rose 4.5% from a year earlier, lagging forecasts and down from July’s 5.1% increase amid weaker commodity prices and auto sales. Retail sales expanded a below-consensus 2.1% from a year ago, easing from July’s 2.7% rise.
The yuan is its strongest in 16 months though, thanks to the central bank’s reluctance to cut rates and rising expectations that authorities will soon unveil stimulus that will revive growth, asset prices and confidence.
Sector-wise, EU tariffs on Chinese EV makers are revised down. BYD saw tariffs cut to 17% from 17.4%, Geely to 19.3% from 19.9%, and SAIC saw a reduction to 36.3% from 37.6%. Despite the tariffs, analysts say Chinese EV prices will remain competitive in Europe when compared to Chinese-made Tesla. Research by Rhodium group suggests tariffs of up to 50% are needed to significantly deter Chinese EV exports.
Tech-front, the U.S. Commerce Department is expected on Monday to propose prohibiting Chinese software and hardware in connected and autonomous vehicles on U.S. roads due to national security concerns, sources told Reuters. The proposed regulation would ban the import and sale of vehicles from China with key communications or automated driving system software or hardware. More details await.
## Single stock
BYD is expected to expand into Pakistan in partnership with Pakistan’s biggest private electricity producer Hub Power’s subsidiary Mega Motor to set up the country’s first electric vehicle assembly plant by 2026.

### JP
Japan’s stock markets rose over the week, with the Nikkei 225 Index gaining 3.1% and the broader TOPIX Index up 2.8%.
The Bank of Japan decided not to raise rates, but it signaled it is in no hurry to raise them again. This helped push the yen to its weakest daily close since September 4, which in turn helped lift Japanese stocks. The yen starts the week on a soft footing after a roller-coaster ride last week. It rallied through 140.00 per dollar for the first time in over a year but closed near 144.00 per dollar for a weekly loss of 2%, its worst week since April.
Data-wise, core CPI rose 2.8% year on year in August, in line with expectations and up from 2.7% in July. The overall CPI rose 3.0%, also matching consensus and up from the prior month’s 2.8%.

### U.S.
U.S. stocks rebounded after a sell-off, led by strong gains in growth stocks, particularly in the tech sector, with NVIDIA playing a key role. Inflation data for August was mixed, with core inflation slightly exceeding expectations, while housing sector data offered some hope as mortgage rates hit their lowest level since February 2023. Treasury yields also reached year-to-date lows, with strong performance in high-yield bonds supported by equity gains and expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut.
FOMC cut rates by 50 basis points (bps), bringing them to a range of 4.75%-5.0%, but signalled a more gradual pace of rate cuts moving forward. The dot plot suggests further cuts totalling 100bps in both 2024 and 2025, indicating a cautious approach. Chairman Powell emphasized that the economy is not at risk of recession, with the labour market remaining a key focus to prevent further deterioration.
While markets had priced in 250bps of cuts over the next year, Powell’s remarks and the dot plot suggest that actual rate cuts will likely be smaller, around 150bps, unless the economy weakens significantly. The Fed will continue to monitor economic data to guide future decisions, implying a flexible policy stance going forward.

### Europe:
Stocks rose following an interest rate cut by the European Central Bank (ECB), though the ECB gave no clear direction on future policy moves. Meanwhile, the UK economy stagnated, but wage growth remained high, complicating inflation control efforts.

### Asia:
Japan saw mixed stock performance, and hawkish comments from policymakers pointed to further rate hikes. However, GDP growth for the second quarter was revised lower. In China, weak inflation data raised concerns of an economic slowdown, although export growth exceeded expectations, providing a rare bright spot amid ongoing challenges in the property sector.

### US:
Stocks ended mixed in light pre-holiday trading with the Nasdaq Composite performing the worst due to NVIDIA's decline of more than 10%.
CPE raise by 0.2% in July, largely as expected, although the year-over-year increase came in a tick lower than consensus, at 2.6%. Investors seemed pleased with confirmation that inflation was remaining subdued and near the Fed’s target, with Nasdaq futures, in particular, surging in the wake of the release.
Personal incomes had increased an unexpected 0.3% in July, up from June’s 0.2%. Personal spending rose even more, 0.5%, although the gain was in line with consensus.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note drifted higher over the week, as hopes appeared to dim that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates by a full 50 basis points (0.50 percentage point) at its mid-September meeting.

### Europe:
European stock indexes rose, with STOXX Europe 600 reaching a record high amidst prospects of ECB interest rate cuts. The pan-European STOXX Europe 600 Index surged by 1.34%, reaching an all-time high. This key indicator continued its upward trend for the fourth consecutive week as significantly slower inflation provided grounds for the European Central Bank (ECB) to consider reducing interest rates in September.
Inflation has approached its target level, with headline annual inflation dropping to 2.2% in August from 2.6% in July—the lowest figure in three years and slightly above the ECB's 2% goal.

### China:
The Shanghai Composite Index is down for 0.43% while HSI is up for 2.17% after mixed corporate earnings data.
Investor downgraded their expectations on some of the key economic data such as Retail Sales, from 4.5% to 4.0%, Fixed Asset Invesment, from 4.4% to 4.2% and Consumer Price Index, from 0.6% to 0.5%. Given the above slowdown in growth, China might not be able to meet it’s GDP target of 5% this year.
In terms of monetary policy, the medium-term lending facilities remains the same at 2.3% while the short term 7 day repo lending rate remains at 1.7%.

### US:

#### Market Movements:
Last week saw significant fluctuations in US stocks. An early-week rally propelled markets to new highs, but the momentum faded towards the end of the week, primarily due to a downturn in the tech sector. The major indices ended mixed: the S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed lower, while the Dow posted a solid gain.

#### Interest Rates and Earnings:
Both stock prices and interest rates had been rising together earlier in 2024. However, recently, interest rates have declined significantly due to moderating inflation and anticipated Fed rate cuts. Despite this, equities continue their uptrend, bolstered by rising corporate earnings.

#### Sector Rotation:
A key theme last week was the rotation in market leadership. The tech sector experienced a pullback, while cyclical sectors, which had lagged this year, gained traction. This shift was highlighted by a robust rally in small-cap stocks. Such changes underscore the importance of maintaining a diversified and balanced investment portfolio.

#### Tech Sector Selloff:
A sharp selloff in high-flying tech stocks led to the S&P 500 experiencing its worst day since December 2022. The index fell 2.3% on Wednesday, breaking a 356-session streak without a 2% decline, its longest streak in 17 years. This came after the index had risen significantly above its 200-day moving average the previous week, a level historically associated with past selloffs.

### Europe:

#### Market Performance:
European stocks are set to open lower on Thursday following significant losses in US stocks overnight, driven by steep declines in the tech sector. European markets extended their losses on Friday, marking the longest losing streak since October 2023. A tech outage caused by defective CrowdStrike software disrupted Microsoft’s Azure and Office365 services, affecting various sectors globally.

#### Index Performance:
By mid-morning CET, the Euro STOXX 50 had fallen 0.5%, and the Euro STOXX 600 was down 0.6%, marking the fifth consecutive session of losses. Major country indices were all in negative territory, with Germany’s DAX down 0.8%, Italy’s FTSE MIB down 0.7%, France’s CAC 40 down 0.7%, and Spain’s Ibex 35 down 0.3%.

#### Travel and Shipping Disruptions:
Travel and shipping sectors were hit hard by the tech outage. Air France-KLM’s Dutch arm halted most operations, leading to a 1.1% drop in its shares. Lufthansa Group shares fell 1.5% amid warnings of potential delays and cancellations. Similarly, low-cost carriers Ryanair and Wizz Air experienced significant check-in system failures, causing shares to drop by 2.9% and 2.1%, respectively.

#### Banking Sector Impact:
European banks also recorded losses, though less severe than those in the travel and shipping sectors. French banks BNP Paribas, Societe Generale, and Credit Agricole saw declines, as did Spanish banks Banco Santander, BBVA, and Bankinter. In Germany, Deutsche Bank shares fell by 1.5%, marking their tenth negative session in the last eleven.

#### Bonds and Currency:
In the bond market, yields held steady, with Bund yields down marginally by 1 basis point to 2.43%. The euro eased by 0.1% against the dollar, falling to 1.0880, while the British pound was down 0.3% to 1.2910.

#### CrowdStrike Fallout:
CrowdStrike Holdings plummeted over 20% in pre-market trading after an update to its cloud platform caused disruptions to Microsoft’s Azure systems. This marked CrowdStrike's worst daily performance since its IPO in 2019. Meanwhile, competitors like SentinelOne, Palo Alto Networks, and Cloudflare saw gains.

### Asia-Pacific (APAC):

#### Chinese Markets:
Chinese shares ended lower due to muted investor sentiment. The Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.5%, the Shenzhen Composite Index declined 1.3%, and the ChiNext Price Index dropped 1.2%. Property and auto stocks led the losses, with limited expectations for property stimulus measures from the upcoming Politburo meeting.

#### Hong Kong:
Hong Kong shares also ended lower, weighed down by technology stocks. The Hang Seng Index fell 0.9%, and the Hang Seng Tech Index declined 1.5%. Major decliners included Meituan and Xiaomi, while gainers included China Resources Power and Cnooc.

#### Japan:
Japanese stocks ended lower amid cautious sentiment over potential Bank of Japan rate increases and a rebounding yen. The Nikkei Stock Average declined 1.1%, with notable drops in Mitsubishi Motors, Isuzu Motors, and Sumitomo Realty & Development.

#### India:
Indian shares closed lower, impacted by finance and bank stocks amid concerns over the budget plan and proposed higher capital gains taxes. The benchmark Sensex declined 0.35%, though Tech Mahindra and Tata Motors saw gains.

#### Broader APAC Trends:
Asian shares were hit hard on Thursday as a global tech slump sent investors fleeing to safer assets like short-dated bonds, the yen, and the Swiss franc. Chinese stocks received little support despite a surprise rate cut by the central bank. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 0.7%, with Japan's Nikkei tumbling 2.9% and South Korea's KOSPI dropping 2%.

<x-accordion summary="Week of 07/07/2024">

### US:
The S&P 500 Index continued to climb to record highs, although the market’s gains remained notably narrow. As measured by Russell 1000 indexes, growth shares outperformed value stocks by 415 basis points (4.15 percentage points), while the small- and mid-cap benchmarks recorded losses.

The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite ended the week 73.71% off its lows since the market began its rebound in mid- to late-2022, while the more value-oriented and narrowly focused Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained less than half of that amount, 32.79%. Markets were closed Thursday in observance of the Independence Day holiday, and T. Rowe Price traders noted lighter trading volumes as the week progressed.

Expectations for lower interest rates, fed by signs of weakening growth and easing inflation pressures, seemed to remain a major factor in favoring growth stocks by placing a lower implied discount on future earnings. On Monday, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) posted its lowest reading of manufacturing activity (48.5, with levels below 50.0 indicating contraction) since February. A separate reading also showed a surprise contraction in construction activity.

While the thought of a slowing economy and a potential recession can be concerning, it is important to remember that they are a natural part of every economic cycle and set the stage for the next growth phase. Fortunately, with the slow unwinding of inflation over the past two years, the Fed should have more room to cut rates, which we believe will shorten the length and severity of a potential recession and help contain the slowdown.

### Europe:
In local currency terms, the pan-European STOXX Europe 600 Index ended 1.01% higher. Political jitters eased as the far right in France failed to win an outright majority in the first round of legislative elections on June 30. Meanwhile, the Labour Party won the UK general election on July 4 with a large majority. Major stock indexes also rose, with France’s CAC 40 Index climbing 2.62%, Germany’s DAX gaining 1.32%, and Italy’s FTSE MIB putting on 2.51%. The UK’s FTSE 100 Index added 0.49%.

A final estimate of eurozone inflation confirmed that the year-over-year change in consumer prices ticked lower in June to 2.5%. However, a crucial services component remained stubbornly high, likely reinforcing the ECB’s case for caution.

### APAC:
Japan’s stock markets gained ground, with the Nikkei 225 Index climbing 3.36% and the broader TOPIX Index advancing 2.65% in local currency terms. Both indexes hit all-time highs during the week, propelled in part by weakness in the Japanese yen, which is typically a tailwind for export-focused industries. The yen strengthened a bit later in the week. In the first three months of the year, Japan’s economy shrank by 2.9% year over year, a sharper contraction than the first estimate that put the decline in gross domestic product (GDP) at 1.8%. The government attributed this revision to corrections in construction orders. The annualized change in GDP was also lowered for the fourth and third quarters of 2023.

Chinese equities fell as underwhelming manufacturing data reinforced concerns about the slowing economy. The Shanghai Composite Index and the blue chip CSI 300 both registered modest losses for the week. In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng Index gained 0.46% during a holiday-shortened week.

The value of new home sales by the country’s top 100 developers fell 17% in June from the prior-year period, easing from a 34% decline in May, according to the China Real Estate Information Corp. The data boosted hopes that China’s housing market, now in its fourth year of a downturn, may start to gain traction after the government announced a sweeping rescue package in May. China's manufacturing sector shrank in June for the second consecutive month, government data showed. The official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) reached 49.5 in June, unchanged from May, as new orders and exports declined. The data reflected the uneven performance of China’s economy this year amid a yearslong property slump that has hit domestic consumption and rising trade tensions that threaten the manufacturing sector.

### US:
Labor Market Recovery: The US economy added 559,000 jobs in June 2024, beating expectations. The unemployment rate declined to 3.8%, signaling a robust labor market recovery. However, wage growth remains moderate, and some sectors face labor shortages.
Consumer Slowdown: Recent data shows a slowdown in US retail sales. Consumers are becoming cautious due to rising inflation, supply chain disruptions, and uncertainties related to the pandemic. This trend could impact economic recovery and corporate profits.

### Eurozone:
Fiscal Challenges: The Eurozone faces fiscal challenges stemming from an aging population. As birth rates decline, the proportion of elderly citizens increases. This puts pressure on pension systems and healthcare budgets. Policymakers must find sustainable solutions to support retirees and maintain economic stability. 
Tight Labor Market: Despite demographic challenges, the Eurozone's labor market remains tight. Skill shortages persist in certain sectors, leading to wage pressures and potential productivity bottlenecks.

### Asia-Pacific (APAC):
Inflation Insights: Japan and the United Kingdom are experiencing easing underlying inflation. This suggests that supply chain disruptions and energy price spikes may be temporary. However, central banks remain vigilant, closely monitoring inflation data to guide monetary policy decisions.
Global Markets Monitor: APAC markets are closely watching upcoming elections (such as India's state elections) and inflation data. Investors are also awaiting Friday's release of the US Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation index, which could impact the Federal Reserve's interest rate trajectory.

### US:
As of Friday close: S&P500: 5432 (+1.6%) ; NADQ Comp: 17688 (+3.2%) ; S&P mid-cap 400: 2895 (-0.8%) ; Russell2000: 2006 (-0.01%)
S&P500 and NADQ touched new highs pushed by AI enthusiasm and technology-related stocks, while small and mid-cap underperformed over the week. Core inflation fell to 3.4%, the lowest since April 2021. The Producer Price Index (PPI) inflation, which was announced on Thursday, came as a surprise by declining 0.2%, contrary to expectations of a slight increase. Furthermore, on a year-over-year basis, the core PPI decreased to 2.3%, putting an end to five consecutive months of growth. In a related trend, import prices also experienced a decline of 0.4% in May, marking their first decrease in four months.
10-year treasury yield decreased from 4.43% to 4.21% after higher-than-expected jobless claims built inflation pressure.
IG corporate bond market was quiet over the week as investors awaited inflation release and Fed’s meeting.

### Japan:
In Japan, the stock markets had a mixed performance for the week, with the Nikkei 225 Index gaining 0.3% while the broader TOPIX Index declined by 0.3%. The Bank of Japan’s (BoJ) June meeting had a dovish tone, which supported the equity market.
In the fixed income markets, the yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) decreased to 0.93% from 0.98% the previous week. The Japanese yen, already at historically low levels, weakened further against the US dollar, with the exchange rate reaching around JPY 157.5 from 156.6.

### China:
Chinese equities faced a decline during a short week, reflecting ongoing deflationary pressures impacting the economy. The Shanghai Composite Index dropped by 0.61%, while the blue chip CSI 300 decreased by 0.91%. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index fell by 2.31% according to FactSet. Chinese markets were closed on Monday for the Dragon Boat Festival.
China’s consumer price index showed a modest increase of 0.3% in May compared to the previous year, matching April’s rise. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, grew by 0.6%, slowing down from April’s 0.7% increase. On the other hand, the producer price index experienced a 1.4% decline compared to the previous year, marking its 20th consecutive month of decline. However, this decline was less severe than the 2.5% drop seen in April. Despite Beijing’s efforts to stimulate the economy and stabilize the markets, weak consumer confidence and a prolonged slump in the property sector have kept prices in China under pressure.

### US: 
The U.S. market experienced mixed results as longer-term bond yields fell. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite reached record highs, while smaller-cap indexes pulled back. Growth stocks outperformed value shares due to falling interest rates. However, the artificial intelligence (AI) sector saw some slowdown as U.S. officials slowed the issuance of licenses for AI chip sales to the Middle East and opened antitrust investigations into Microsoft and NVIDIA.

The major indexes had varied performances for the week, with the DJIA up 2.94%, S&P 500 up 12.10%, Nasdaq Composite up 14.13%, S&P MidCap 400 down 5.00%, and Russell 2000 down slightly by 0.03% year-to-date.

### China:

In economic news, the private Caixin/S&P Global survey showed a slight improvement in manufacturing activity, with a reading of 51.7 in May compared to 51.4 in April, indicating the seventh consecutive month of expansion. The Caixin services purchasing managers' index also exceeded expectations, reaching 54 in May, up from 52.5 in April. This private survey focused on smaller and export-oriented firms, adding to official data from the previous week, which showed an unexpected contraction in manufacturing activity in May.

### US:

US ended higher for the week as it tapped into the second week of the earnings release. A cooler labor market, as indicated by lower-than-expected nonfarm payrolls, lowered the inflationary pressure and gave investors a greater hope of loosening interest rates. Powell’s response to the data also pushed back stagflation worries which further encouraged investors.

For individual stocks, AAPL beat consensus revenue expectations and announced the largest buyback of 110bn USD helped boost investors’ confidence. TSLA also lifted the market after a 15% rally under China’s tentative approval of the self-driving technology.

### Europe: 

Europe ended lower amid mixed earnings and an unsure interest rate outlook. The German DAX index experienced a decrease of 0.88%, while France’s CAC 40 Index saw a decline of 1.62%. Italy’s FTSE MIB index also weakened, with a decrease of 1.81%. In contrast, the UK’s FTSE 100 Index registered a gain of 0.90% and reached a new high, primarily fueled by the robust performance of mining and energy stocks.

### Asia: 
Chinese stocks rose during a week as investors expressed optimism regarding increased government assistance that China would utilize various monetary policy tools, such as potential interest rate reductions and adjustments to the reserve requirement ratio. SSEC rose by 0.52%, while the prominent CSI 300 index of blue-chip stocks saw a slight gain of 0.56%. A larger rally in Hong Kong with the surge of HSI by 4.67%.

### US:

Stocks recorded their third consecutive week of broad losses, as concerns over tensions in the Middle East and the possibility of U.S. interest rates remaining high. Mega-cap technology shares lagged as rising rates placed a higher theoretical discount on future earnings.

Some strong economic data appeared to increase worries that the Federal Reserve would push back any interest rates cuts to the fall, if not to 2025. On Monday, the Commerce Department reported that retail sales rose 0.7% in March, well above consensus expectations of around 0.3%, while February’s gain was revised upward to 0.9%. The retail sales data helped push the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note to its highest intraday level since last November.

Fed officials expressed their concern with recent economic data. On Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated at an economic conference that "recent data have clearly not given us greater confidence and instead indicate that it’s likely to take longer than expected to achieve that confidence."

### Europe: 

Consumer prices in the UK grew an annual 3.2% in March, down from 3.4% in February. Although the inflation rate fell to its lowest level in two and a half years, the decline was slightly less than forecast by Bank of England (BoE) due to elevated price growth in fuel and communication goods. Higher oil prices and the somewhat sticky inflation data prompted financial markets to push out expectations for a first cut in UK interest rates from June to sometime in the fall.

European Central Bank (ECB) policymakers at the IMF meeting reiterated that June was the likely target date for lowering borrowing costs, barring unexpected economic shocks. Three to four rate cuts this year priced in by markets were in line with the bank’s economic outlook.

### Asia: 
Chinese equities rose after the economy expanded more than expected in the first quarter. The Shanghai Composite Index gained 1.52%, while the blue chip CSI 300 added 1.89%. In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng Index gave up 2.89% as escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East hurt investor sentiment.

China’s gross domestic product expanded an above-consensus 5.3% in the first quarter from a year ago, accelerating slightly from the 5.2% growth in last year’s fourth quarter. On the monetary policy front, the People’s Bank of China injected RMB 100 billion into the banking system via its medium-term lending facility compared with RMB 170 billion in maturing loans and left the lending rate unchanged, as expected. The operation resulted in a net withdrawal of RMB 70 billion from the banking system, marking the second cash extraction this year.

### US:

While the S&P 500 ended a record-setting streak by falling just below the flatline, it still managed to secure a win for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average saw a slight increase of about 0.2%, whereas the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite experienced a minor drop close to 0.4%. This mixed closing was amid investors bracing for the Fed's upcoming meeting, focusing on potential rate cuts and the central bank's latest viewpoint on inflation and economic growth.

The week also highlighted anticipation for major tech companies' earnings reports, with Alphabet and Microsoft set to start the earnings season. These reports are keenly watched due to the significant influence these companies have on both the global economy and investors' portfolios.

Furthermore, the US market witnessed crude oil gaining more than 6% over the week, driven by bullish economic data and ongoing tensions in the Red Sea region. This rise in oil prices was supported by freezing temperatures affecting US production, a reduction in crude inventories, and various global economic factors.

### Europe: 
The Swiss National Bank made a surprise interest rate cut, becoming the first major financial center to do so recently. Investors were also anticipating major economies' manufacturing PMI and CPI data as they continue to address inflation concerns.

Additionally, European stocks experienced mixed movements, with the tech sector influencing Wall Street's performance and Bitcoin's value jumping significantly. The Dutch TTF benchmark for European gas prices saw a significant decrease, suggesting a possible easing of the energy
crisis.

### Asia: 
Chinese regulators reportedly blocked Syngenta's planned $9bn Shanghai IPO due to liquidity concerns. Indian stocks did not experience the traditional pre-election rally as the country prepares for parliamentary elections; US yields and a significant earthquake impacted markets like Nikkei and Hang Seng. Meanwhile, China's solar sector is facing oversupply and low prices, suggesting a year of consolidation ahead.

### US: 

Oil Prices Rise on Strong Global Demand and Fed Rate Cut Expectations: Oil prices rose on March 13, 2024, on expectations of strong global demand, including in the United States, and as even somewhat sticky U.S. inflation did not dent expectations the Fed might start cutting rates soon. Brent futures for May delivery were up 36 cents, or 0.44%, at $82.28 a barrel.

US Consumer Prices Rise: The consumer price index increased 0.4% for the month of February and 3.2% from a year ago. The monthly gain was in line with expectations, but the annual rate was slightly ahead of the 3.1% forecast from the Dow Jones consensus.

US Fed: The Federal Reserve held its key interest rate steady Wednesday for the fifth consecutive meeting, as the central bank awaits more data to determine when to cut rates.

### Europe: 

European and US Equity Futures Trade Higher: On March 18, 2024, European and US equity futures traded higher following a selloff in equities and bonds when markets rounded off a week that saw hot inflation concerns roiled markets.

Europe's Worst Earnings Season Since Covid: Europe had its worst earnings season since the onset of Covid.

Red Sea Situation and Fruit Exports: Maersk's March 2024 market update covered the Red Sea situation, fruit exports, port updates, inland solutions, labor regulations, and last-mile strategies.

### US:
The U.S. stock market mostly ended higher for the week, driven by favorable inflation news. The Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 reached record levels, with the S&P 500 having its strongest start to the year since 2019. The gains were broad-based, with an equal-weighted version of the S&P 500 outperforming the market capitalization version. Large, technology-oriented growth stocks continued to outperform, contributing to the overall performance.

The release of the Commerce Department’s core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which is considered the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation, helped boost market sentiment. The index rose 2.8% for the 12 months ended in January, in line with expectations, alleviating concerns raised by the Labor Department’s consumer price index, which showed higher-than-expected core prices. Despite the positive reaction in the stock market, Federal Reserve policymakers maintained their stance of not rushing to cut interest rates.

The manufacturing sector, however, surrendered some of its recent momentum, with the Institute for Supply Management’s (ISM) gauge of manufacturing activity falling below expectations in February. Durable goods showed a more positive outlook, and personal incomes saw a significant increase in February.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note reached its lowest level in weeks, reflecting the positive reaction to the PCE data and the downside surprise in the manufacturing sector. U.S. Treasuries generated positive returns as yields decreased, and municipal bonds received an additional boost from light issuance.

In the investment-grade corporate bond market, spreads widened due to heavy supply, as February saw a record-breaking amount of new issuance. High yield market trading activity was subdued early in the week but tightened credit spreads following the release of the core PCE price data.

Overall, the U.S. stock market experienced gains, driven by positive inflation news, while the manufacturing sector showed a slight decline. Bond markets reacted positively to the economic data, and corporate bond issuance reached a new record in February.
