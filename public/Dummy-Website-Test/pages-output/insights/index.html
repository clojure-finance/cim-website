Understanding these factors is crucial for investors and policymakers navigating the evolving energy landscape.</p><h4 id="key-historical-phases">Key Historical Phases</h4><p>After WWII, oil prices remained relatively stable due to the rapid industrialisation of Western economies. The establishment of OPEC in 1960 marked a turning point, as it began to exert more control over oil production and pricing. The 1973 Yom Kippur War led to an oil embargo by Arab nations, causing prices to quadruple. The Iranian Revolution 1979 further destabilised oil supplies, driving prices up to approximately $97 per barrel by 1980.</p><p>The early 1980s saw a brief price decline due to economic recession and increased production from non-OPEC countries. The Gulf War 1990 caused another spike, but prices stabilised in the late 1990s due to increased production and a global economic slowdown. In the early 2000s, prices rose significantly, driven by demand from emerging economies like China and India, peaking at over $140 per barrel in mid-2008 before the financial crisis led to a sharp decline. The U.S. shale boom increased global oil supply, leading to a price collapse, with Brent crude falling below $30 per barrel in early 2016.</p><h4 id="the-oil-dollar-system">The Oil-Dollar System</h4><p>The U.S. and Saudi Arabia agreed to settle oil trades in U.S. dollars in 1974, creating a petrodollar system that strengthened the dollar's role as a global reserve currency. The collapse of the Bretton Woods system and the subsequent dollar devaluation played a crucial role in the surge in oil prices in the 1970s. The establishment of the petrodollar system further linked the dollar's value to the oil market. A weaker dollar means more dollars are needed to purchase the same amount of oil; hence, the price increases.</p><h4 id="geopolitical-events-and-market-speculation">Geopolitical Events and Market Speculation</h4><p>Historically, wars, sanctions, and political instability in oil-producing regions have caused significant price spikes. The Gulf War and tensions between Russia and Ukraine have influenced global oil markets. The oil market is often overly sensitive to potential war or production cut news, with rumours sometimes leading to price increases. This phenomenon is partly due to the mental inertia caused by the repetition of historical events, leading to market speculation. Traders and investors often predict the future based on past experiences, reacting quickly to similar situations and exacerbating market volatility. Anticipation of conflict can lead traders to speculate on price increases, further driving up costs even before any actual disruption occurs.</p><p>Conflicts often lead to physical disruptions in oil production or transportation routes. Increased trade barriers, sanctions, or physical disruptions to production and transportation infrastructure can lead to shortages and costs. The concept of a "war premium" embedded in oil prices due to geopolitical tensions is well-documented. For instance, estimates suggest a war premium of about $25 per barrel was present even before recent escalations involving Iran and Israel</p><h4 id="the-rise-of-new-energy">The Rise of New Energy</h4><p>In the long term, the use of new energy sources may undermine the dominance of oil. With increasing environmental awareness and technological advancements, more countries and companies are increasing investment in renewable energy. The widespread use of clean energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydropower will gradually reduce dependence on traditional fossil fuels. The increasing popularity of electric vehicles will also reduce the gasoline demand, further weakening oil's dominance in the energy market.</p><p>Source:</p><ol><li>https://www.eia.gov/finance/markets/crudeoil/spot_prices.php</li><li>https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/brent-crude-oil</li><li>https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/economic-bulletin/focus/2024/html/ecb.ebbox202402_01~b3d857ae05.en.html</li><li>https://about.bnef.com/blog/oils-25-war-premium-on-iran-israel-risk-can-rapidly-fizzle-out/</li></ol></x-accordion><x-accordion summary="India, the Star of Emerging Markets: Opportunities and Risk"><p><em>Written by Alexander ANTONIOU, 10/02/2025</em></p><h3 id="india-the-star-of-emerging-markets-opportunities-and-risk">India, the Star of Emerging Markets: Opportunities and Risk</h3><p>Emerging markets have not seen the same attention of the BRICS era since the global financial crisis, highlighted by a lagging Chinese economy and US dollar strength. Nonetheless, India stands out as an exceptional outlier from pessimistic investor outlook surrounding emerging markets. India has outperformed US equities since 2019, with the benchmark Nifty 50 index having doubled over the past five years.</p><p>India’s economy has outperformed the global economy and emerging markets, boasting GDP growth over 6% over the past 45 years, whilst set to overtake Germany and Japan to become the third-largest economy by 2030. Despite stellar growth, high shares of Indians still face unemployment, stagnant wages, and widening income inequality. Some investors fear that a speculative bubble surrounding Indian equities has formed, fuelled by tens of millions of first-time domestic investors piling into stocks and mutual funds.</p><p>India remains a good investment opportunity with diversification across various expanding sectors and growing IPOs. Many investors are sceptical as high valuations in the Indian equity market require strong judgement and careful management; stock picking remains key.</p><h4 id="three-sectors-to-watch">Three sectors to watch:</h4><p>Infrastructure investment has been on the forefront of the government’s economic strategy through initiatives such as ‘Make in India’. This initiative aims to boost domestic manufacturing through infrastructure development and industrialisation, creating demand for machinery, construction materials, and technological solutions. The Union Budget 2025 is expected to increase infrastructure’s allocation to ₹18 lakh crore from ₹11.11 lakh crore in 2024.</p><p>India’s healthcare sector is evolving with rising incomes and improved health awareness in liaise with pandemic efforts to elevate the healthcare landscape of a growing population. Investors expect a structural increase in domestic healthcare from both government and the private sector; schemes like Ayushman Bharat Yojana (aka Modicare) aim to increase access to healthcare through free health insurance for lower income households.</p><p>Renewable energy is prominent in India, with a goal of achieving net zero by 2070. In 2024, India’s renewable energy capacity reached 205GW, putting it on track to make its 500GW target for 2030; this target constitutes meeting 50% of India’s electricity needs from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030.

The perceived arrogant leader signed over 20 executive orders and actions on his Inauguration Day ‒ more than any previous US president. Trump has announced many changes so far. Many keywords and aspects can ring the bell of investors’ minds – Tariffs, AI, crypto, Staff, Greenland, Panama Canel, China, wars, taxes, expenditures, immigrants, and more. These all added complexities to the current global markets. Due to space and word limitations, this weekly update will focus on two of the most-discussed areas of the Trump administration: Trade Policy and AI.</p><h4 id="trade-policy-how-to-navigate-through-the-pivots">Trade Policy: How to navigate through the pivots?</h4><p>Trump has been known for his aggressiveness in imposing tariffs. In the election period, he claimed to increase tariffs on China heavily upon his presidency. Trump's tariffs externally act as bargaining chips with nations and internally offset the cost incurred by the tax-cut policy. The market has been concerned about the consequent deterioration of international relationships resulting in trade wars and potential re-inflation as import products become more expensive upon the tariff rise.</p><p>Instead of aiming at China as in the campaign last year, Trump began by pivoting to Canada, Mexico and Colombia, which was a pretty surprising approach. Trump first announced plans for 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. As for China, on 22 January, Trump proposed a 10% tariff on Chinese goods. China and Hong Kong stock markets fell sharply. The Hong Kong market ended six consecutive rallies, and the Hang Seng Index (HSI) fell below 20,000 points. However, this tariff is significantly lower than the 60% suggested in his election campaign. Trump’s claim two days later confirmed his “temporary leniency” over China, as he said he “would rather not raise tariffs in China”. This brought HSI back up to 20,000 points. On the other hand, weaker than expected, a 2.5% tariff on goods from the Eurozone was also mentioned. European luxury goods stocks performed strongly. For instance, since 20 January, LVMH advanced 10% and Hermès climbed 6.5%. Unexpected tariff leniency resulted in the correction of The Dollar Index by up to 1% since his Inauguration Day. Some suggested that Trump may have switched to a more gradual approach in handling tariffs.</p><p>To Trump, tariffs are now viewed as bargaining chips. The aforementioned 10% tariff threat was indeed in response to China's role as a major supplier of fentanyl raw materials, as well as to push China to approve a potential US deal with TikTok. Trump also coerced Colombia to accept deportees using the same tariff tactic. As concerns evolve and change across time, Trump’s claims – but not concrete actions – on tariffs could show little implication for the medium- to long-term economy. PIMCO’s head of US public policy Libby Cantrill opined that the market should not "extrapolate too much” from the initial delays on Trump tariffs. Given that Trump’s style is often more ideological and exaggerated, investors are already prudently observing the new administration’s moves and distinguishing factors from noises.</p><h4 id="ai-headwind-or-tailwind-ahead">AI: Headwind or tailwind ahead?</h4><p>On 21 January, Trump announced a $500 billion (€480 billion) investment in artificial intelligence infrastructure in the US. Unsurprisingly, many tech giants saw impressive gains on 22 January. Nvidia surged more than 4%, pushing its market capitalisation to $3.6 trillion, surpassing Apple once again. Microsoft also saw a rise of around 4%, while Arm experienced a jump of nearly 16%. Foreign players also rose. Siemens Energy shares soared more than 10% this week following the announcement. The German energy company anticipates a “massive tailwind” as it manufactures equipment ranging from gas and wind turbines to power network components. On top of the technology sector, Trump urged banks to loosen regulations and collaborate with tech giants to invest billions in developing AI technology. The Financial Select Sector Index rose 6.32% YTD as of 29 January.</p><p>Although the technology sector was significantly suppressed as the Chinese AI model Deepseek advanced in the final week of January, Trump affirmed that the US is in a position to compete and regarded Deepseek as a “wake-up call”. Market views his response as the beginning of a competitive yet flourishing AI era, expecting strong demand in the technology sector in the medium to long horizons.</p><p>Source:</p><ol><li>https://www.euronews.com/business/2025/01/24/a-round-up-of-global-stock-markets-in-trumps-inauguration-week</li><li>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/28/first-thing-donald-trump-calls-chinas-deepseek-ai-chatbot-a-wake-up-call</li><li>https://www.investing.com/news/economy/feds-decision-tsmc-sales-bitcoin--whats-moving-markets-3710787</li><li>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/trump-2-0-threatens-tariffs-by-no-action-yet-markets-see-it-as-gradualist-approach-ubi-report/articleshow/117668761.cms</li><li>https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tiktok-is-intertwined-with-tariffs-as-trump-weighs-his-one-very-big-power-over-china-175829571.html</li><li>http://www.aastocks.com/tc/stocks/news/comment.aspx?id=37504</li><li>https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/1/27/how-trump-coerced-colombia-to-accept-deportees-by-threatening-us-tariff-war</li></ol></x-accordion><x-accordion summary="Gold price forecast: analysis of key moving factors"><p><em>Written by Hong Yee Ching Robin, 26/01/2025</em></p><h3 id="gold-price-forecast-analysis-of-key-moving-factors">Gold price forecast: analysis of key moving factors</h3><h4 id="general-forecast-on-trend">General forecast on trend</h4><p>Gold notched its best annual performance in over a decade last year. The prices rose about 26% in 2024, driven by central bank as well as retail investor purchases. Gold has always been the yellow metal that act as a hedge against risk. JPMorgan analysts also expect gold prices to rise, especially if U.S. policies become “more disruptive” in the form of increased tariffs, elevated trade tensions and higher risks to economic growth. Besides the geopolitical uncertainty that will occur in the foreseeable future, the high interest rates that central banks in most of the countries are maintaining.</p><h4 id="potential-reasons">Potential reasons</h4><p>Geopolitical uncertainty: Flows of cash are expected to remain the same and buy Gold as the alternative assets for Central Banks and retail investors. This is due to the unstable border between Russia and Ukraine, Israel and Palestine, and the economic and political tension between the US and China. Tom Mulqueen, metals strategist at Citi Global Markets also stated that they consider “the gold bull market has taken a pause following U.S. presidential elections but should resume in 2025 underpinned by further deterioration in the U.S. labor market, still-high interest rates weighing on growth, and higher ETF demand”.</p><p>Central Banks: Central banks, which slowed gold purchases in late 2024, might also return as buyers if prices correct significantly. The World Gold Council survey also revealed in the second half of 2024 that Central Banks are likely to purchase more Gold in the next 12 months. This should further bolster demand for the precious metal. Interest rates are also expected to cut at a slow pace, where lower interest rates is another factor expected to bolster gold prices next year. This should reduce the opportunity cost of holding gold, which is non-interest-bearing.</p><h4 id="concluding-the-forecast">Concluding the forecast</h4><p>It is possible that there will be a slightly deeper correction before the price actually breaches the current all time high resting around the 2790 handle. Despite short-term challenges, UBS remains bullish on gold for the next 12 months, projecting prices to reach $2,900/oz by the end of 2025.</p><p>Source: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/06/gold-copper-oil-price-outlook-2025.html</p></x-accordion><x-accordion summary="2024 Summary: Major events happened and its impact on the bond market"><p><em>Written by Charles SHI Qiyuan, 12/01/2025</em></p><h3 id="q1-central-banks-cautious-actions-and-market-stability">Q1: Central Banks' Cautious Actions and Market Stability</h3><p>In the first quarter of 2024, major central banks maintained high interest rates to manage inflation and prevent economic recession. After two years of multiple interest rate hikes, both the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank adopted a more cautious approach to rate hikes, signaling the possibility of pausing or gradually lowering rates. The Federal Reserve decided to keep the federal funds rate steady at 5.25%-5.5%, emphasizing the slowdown in economic growth amid inflationary pressures and the uncertainty in financial markets. Although inflation in the Eurozone showed signs of easing, the ECB's expectations for rate cuts were not strong. The Bank of England maintained its rate at 5.25%. Meanwhile, China’s economy showed a stronger-than-expected recovery post-pandemic, with manufacturing and consumer spending picking up, which positively impacted GDP growth expectations.</p><p>With interest rates remaining stable, the bond market maintained relatively steady yields in the short term. Due to the delayed expectations of rate cuts and the generally cautious sentiment in the market, fixed-income assets became more attractive compared to equities. This drove some investors to shift towards long-term bonds in search of higher fixed returns.</p><h3 id="q2-ecb-rate-cuts-and-the-developments-in-the-us-debt-situation">Q2: ECB Rate Cuts and the Developments in the U.S. Debt Situation</h3><p>In June, the European Central Bank reduced its three key policy rates by 25 basis points, marking its first rate cut of the year. The main refinancing rate was lowered to 4.25%, the marginal lending rate to 4.50%, and the deposit rate to 3.75%. The move aimed to support economic recovery by reducing borrowing costs and alleviating growth pressures, thereby bolstering market confidence. As a result, Eurozone government bond prices generally rose, and yields declined. The yield on the 10-year German Bund even briefly fell to 2.2%. Investors, seeking to lock in higher returns, shifted towards longer-dated bonds, increasing demand and prices for long-term debt.</p><p>At the same time, concerns arose regarding the U.S. government’s debt limit, as negotiations in Congress to raise the borrowing cap remained unresolved. This uncertainty led to heightened market caution, with short-term U.S. Treasury yields rising as investors sought higher returns to offset perceived risks (with one-month Treasury yields briefly surpassing 8%). The uncertainty contributed to increased volatility in equity markets and a shift toward safe-haven assets like gold. Within the bond market, investor preference leaned toward ultra-short-term U.S. Treasuries, while other segments saw more muted activity. After an agreement was reached to raise the debt ceiling, an accelerated pace of Treasury issuance led to a temporary increase in supply, applying downward pressure on bond prices.</p><h3 id="q3-stock-market-volatility-and-central-bank-policy-shifts">Q3: Stock Market Volatility and Central Bank Policy Shifts</h3><p>On August 5th, global stock markets experienced a sharp decline, with major markets in Europe, the U.S., and Japan triggering multiple circuit breakers. This event, referred to by some as a "Black Monday," led investors to seek safe-haven assets, resulting in significant capital inflows into the bond market. The shift in risk sentiment increased demand for bonds, pushing prices higher and yields lower. For instance, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond fell by two basis points to 3.78%, while Germany’s yield dropped by nine basis points to 2.13%. While stock market volatility can enhance the relative attractiveness of bonds, heightened uncertainty may also reduce market liquidity, contributing to price fluctuations.</p><p>In September, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 50 basis points, triggering short-term volatility in the U.S. Treasury market. The short end of the yield curve declined notably as some investors shifted from short-term to long-term U.S. Treasuries, driving up their prices. Meanwhile, lower borrowing costs for corporations and governments supported economic activity, leading to adjustments in global asset allocations as capital flowed into the U.S. Treasury market. The ECB and the Bank of England also implemented rate cuts in September, contributing to a general decline in bond yields and an increase in bond prices. The reduction in financing costs enhanced the appeal of Eurozone bonds within global asset portfolios, helping to stabilize market sentiment.</p><h3 id="q4-us-treasury-market-adjustments-and-chinas-offshore-us-dollar-bond-issuance">Q4: U.S. Treasury Market Adjustments and China’s Offshore U.S. Dollar Bond Issuance</h3><p>In October, the U.S. Treasury market experienced notable adjustments as the seven largest foreign holders of U.S. debt collectively reduced their holdings, following five consecutive months of increases. This shift marked a transition from accumulation to a more cautious approach, with some investors trimming their positions. Notably, China reduced its holdings by $11.9 billion to $760.1 billion, the lowest level since February 2009, while Japan also decreased its holdings by $20.6 billion. These moves reflected evolving investor sentiment toward U.S. Treasuries, influenced by a combination of domestic and international economic and policy factors. The large-scale sell-off contributed to a decline in bond prices, driving yields higher. This, in turn, increased government borrowing costs, potentially affecting broader economic conditions, including employment trends. Additionally, shifts in demand for U.S. Treasuries contributed to market volatility and added to investor caution.</p><p>In November, China issued $2 billion in sovereign bonds in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, comprising a $1.25 billion 3-year tranche and a $750 million 5-year tranche, with coupon rates of 4.284% and 4.340%, respectively. This issuance expanded the supply of offshore U.S. dollar-denominated sovereign bonds and supported the development of China’s offshore bond markets in both primary and secondary markets. The offering achieved the lowest spread in the U.S. dollar bond market to date, providing a pricing benchmark for Chinese institutions seeking U.S. dollar financing. Additionally, it contributed to the development of the offshore U.S. dollar bond yield curve, serving as a reference for similar issuances. The total subscription amount reached $39.73 billion—19.9 times the issuance size—highlighting strong investor demand and the role of Chinese sovereign bonds in global market diversification.</p></x-accordion><x-accordion summary="2024 Summary: Major events in the Equity Market"><p><em>Written by Sarah LEONG Si Ian, 29/12/2024</em></p><p>In 2024, the market performed more optimistically than expected, where there were concerns of recession, inflation, the US election and some more geopolitical incidents. This has been reflected in a growth of 13% of S&amp;P 500 earnings, whereas prices of private credits grew by 11%.</p><p>In March, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) announced an increase in the interest rate to a range between 0% to 0.1%, marking the end of the era of negative interest rate in Japan for 17 years. In late July, the BOJ again announced a 0.25% increase in its interest rate, which caused a serious downturn in the stock market afterwards in August. While the BOJ has been hiking its interest rate, the Fed has announced its first interest rate cut in September since pandemic recovery, causing a drop in the Federal Funds Rate by 50 basis points to a range of 4.75% to 5.00%.</p><p>Following Trump’s Election in November, US indexes have reached a record high. The Dow surged by 3.6%, adding over 1,500 points, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rose by 2.5% and 3%, respectively. Several market sectors are expecting deregulation from Trump’s government. Tesla, with its CEO Elon Musk being the supporter of Trump, has recorded a 15% rise in its stock price after the election.</p><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has remained highly potential. This can be reviewed by up to a 33% jump in NASDAQ and high increases in other US indexes. Nvidia, a chipmaker, has benefited the most from the recent AI trend and twice officially become the world’s most valuable publicly traded company in 2024. On the other hand, crypto is another era with high growth following the launch of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds in January 2024. Further growth is seen after Trump’s election in November, which was financially supported by the crypto industry.</p><p>Sources:

Higher tariffs could lead to increased costs for consumers, potentially exacerbating trade deficits and contributing to inflation and deglobalization trends.</p><h4 id="energy-initiatives">Energy Initiatives</h4><p>Trump plans to boost the production of U.S. fossil fuels, emphasizing increased drilling activities from day one. He aims to open new areas for oil exploration, arguing that this would lower energy costs. However, analysts express skepticism about the feasibility and long-term impact of these measures.</p><h4 id="sectoral-impacts">Sectoral Impacts</h4><h5 id="automotive-industry">Automotive Industry</h5><p>Electric Vehicle Tariffs: Increased tariffs could affect electric vehicle (EV) exports from China. Domestic automakers like General Motors (GM), Ford (F), and Stellantis (STLAM) may benefit from reduced competition, with shares of GM and Ford recently rising by 2.5% and 5.6%, respectively.
Regulatory Changes: Companies like Toyota could gain if EV regulations are reduced or eliminated, given their focus on hybrid vehicles over all-electric models.
Tesla's Market Performance: Shares of Tesla soared by 15%, reaching a new 52-week high, partly influenced by CEO Elon Musk's active engagement in key markets.</p><h5 id="clean-energy-sector">Clean Energy Sector</h5><p>Trump's policies may lead to reduced investment in renewable energy within the U.S. Companies like Plug Power (PLUG) and Sunrun (RUN) experienced significant stock declines of 22% and 30%, respectively. In Europe, renewable energy firms such as Orsted (ORSTED) and Nordex (NDX1) also saw their shares fall by 13% and 8%.</p><h5 id="semiconductor-industry">Semiconductor Industry</h5><p>There is debate over whether Trump would continue supporting the "Chips and Science Act," which he previously criticized. Experts believe he may uphold the act due to bipartisan support for domestic semiconductor manufacturing. The legislation, launched in 2022, has already facilitated significant investments from companies like TSMC and Samsung, offering them $6.6 billion and $6.4 billion, respectively, to build factories in the U.S.
Past policies have affected companies like Huawei, ZTE (000063.SZ), and SMIC (0981.HK), which faced challenges due to trade restrictions. Continued policies could impact China's ability to hire overseas talent and acquire semiconductor equipment, as evidenced by a one-third increase in China's imports of semiconductor equipment to $24.12 billion in the first nine months of this year.</p><h4 id="impacts-on-individual-stocks-and-crypto-markets">Impacts on Individual Stocks and Crypto Markets</h4><p>Trump Media &amp; Technology Group (TMTG): The stock hit a two-week low after initial excitement faded. It peaked at $51 on October 29 but retracted to $27 by November 8, as investors reassessed its fundamentals.
Bitcoin: Bitcoin reached new highs at $76,167, up 10% over the past five days, amid speculation about potential crypto-friendly regulations.</p><h4 id="conclusion-1">Conclusion</h4><p>The market is expected to experience increased volatility in response to these policy proposals.

The company's GPU Technology Conference (GTC) 2024 has begun, and investors are anticipating details on the GPUs based on its next-generation architecture, Blackwell.

SHEIN, the fast-fashion giant, has confidentially filed to go public in the U.S. The company was last valued at $66 billion and could be ready to start trading on the public markets as soon as 2024 Q2.

It operates various skincare and color cosmetics brands, including Galénic, DR.WU, Eve Lom, and Perfect Diary. Yatsen focuses on providing high-quality beauty products to consumers in China and internationally.</p><p>As of March 7th, 6:52 pm GMT, the stock price of YSG is $0.51 USD, reflecting a month-on-month decline of 18.9% and a year-on-year decline of 31.8%.
Yatsen has experienced both growth and challenges in its financial performance. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the company reported a 6.7% increase in total net revenues compared to the prior year period.</p><p>However, the company’s total net revenues for the full year of 2023 decreased by 7.9% compared to the previous year, indicating a potential slowdown in growth. Yatsen also reported a net loss of RMB 750.2 million (US$105.7 million) for the full year of 2023, which decreased by 8.7% compared to the prior year period. This was primarily due to significantly increased marketing expenses while sales volume remained weak. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2023, the company recorded a goodwill impairment, indicating that the carrying value of the Eve Lom reporting unit exceeded its fair value. This impairment was primarily attributed to weaker operating results than expected at the time of acquisition. Such impairments can negatively impact investor confidence and lead to a decline in the stock price.</p><p>In terms of past deals, Yatsen has focused on brand acquisition and geographical expansion. In 2020, the company acquired the beauty brand Little Ondine and the French skincare player Galenic. In 2021, it acquired the British premium skincare brand Eve Lom. In 2023, Yatsen’s jointly built factory with Cosmax Inc., a major cosmetics manufacturer in South Korea, began operations in Guangzhou, China.
Looking ahead, Yatsen aims to pursue sustainable growth through ongoing innovation across its brands. The company’s strategic plan includes brand repositioning, new product launches, and a focus on enhancing research and development capabilities. With the newly built factory, Yatsen is transitioning from an OEM to an ODM business model, which is expected to improve quality control and potentially lead to an increase in sales volume in future reporting periods.</p><p>Source:</p><ol><li><a href="https://ir.yatsenglobal.com/">Investors | Yatsen Group - Investor Relations Home</a></li><li><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/yatsen-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2023-financial-results-302081184.html">Yatsen Announces Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Results</a></li><li><a href="https://warburgpincus.com/investments/yatsen-global/">Yatsen Global - Warburg Pincus</a></li><li><a href="https://ir.yatsenglobal.com/2021-03-02-Yatsen-to-Acquire-Prestige-Skincare-Brand-Eve-Lom">Yatsen Global - News Release</a></li></ol></x-accordion><x-accordion summary="AI, Consumer Staples, Interest Rates &amp; Fixed Income, and Geographical Diversification"><p><em>Written by Jonathan Chen, 14/6/2024</em></p><p>U.S. Equities and AI: The technology sector, particularly companies involved in artificial intelligence (AI), remains a strong investment theme.
