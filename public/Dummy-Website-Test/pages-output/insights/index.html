<meta name="description" content="HeadlinesWritten by Erika Lau, 8/11/2024Key Economic Policies Proposed by Donald Trump and Their Sectoral ImpactsTariffs and TradeDonald Trump has proposed increasing tariffs on imports, suggesting rates of up to 60% for China and 10% for other countries. Higher tariffs could lead to increased costs for consumers, potentially exacerbating trade deficits and contributing to inflation and deglobalization trends.Energy InitiativesTrump plans to boost the production of U.S. fossil fuels, emphasizing increased drilling activities from day one. He aims to open new areas for oil exploration, arguing that this would lower energy costs. However, analysts express skepticism about the feasibility and long-term impact of these measures.Sectoral ImpactsAutomotive IndustryElectric Vehicle Tariffs: Increased tariffs could affect electric vehicle (EV) exports from China. Domestic automakers like General Motors (GM), Ford (F), and Stellantis (STLAM) may benefit from reduced competition, with shares of GM and Ford recently rising by 2.5% and 5.6%, respectively.
Regulatory Changes: Companies like Toyota could gain if EV regulations are reduced or eliminated, given their focus on hybrid vehicles over all-electric models.
Tesla&#39;s Market Performance: Shares of Tesla soared by 15%, reaching a new 52-week high, partly influenced by CEO Elon Musk&#39;s active engagement in key markets.Clean Energy SectorTrump&#39;s policies may lead to reduced investment in renewable energy within the U.S. Companies like Plug Power (PLUG) and Sunrun (RUN) experienced significant stock declines of 22% and 30%, respectively. In Europe, renewable energy firms such as Orsted (ORSTED) and Nordex (NDX1) also saw their shares fall by 13% and 8%.Semiconductor IndustryThere is debate over whether Trump would continue supporting the &quot;Chips and Science Act,&quot; which he previously criticized. Experts believe he may uphold the act due to bipartisan support for domestic semiconductor manufacturing. The legislation, launched in 2022, has already facilitated significant investments from companies like TSMC and Samsung, offering them $6.6 billion and $6.4 billion, respectively, to build factories in the U.S.
Past policies have affected companies like Huawei, ZTE (000063.SZ), and SMIC (0981.HK), which faced challenges due to trade restrictions. Continued policies could impact China&#39;s ability to hire overseas talent and acquire semiconductor equipment, as evidenced by a one-third increase in China&#39;s imports of semiconductor equipment to $24.12 billion in the first nine months of this year.Impacts on Individual Stocks and Crypto MarketsTrump Media &amp; Technology Group (TMTG): The stock hit a two-week low after initial excitement faded. It peaked at $51 on October 29 but retracted to $27 by November 8, as investors reassessed its fundamentals.
Bitcoin: Bitcoin reached new highs at $76,167, up 10% over the past five days, amid speculation about potential crypto-friendly regulations.ConclusionThe market is expected to experience increased volatility in response to these policy proposals. Investors should pay close attention to news and potential headwinds arising from new policies and statements, adjusting their strategies accordingly.Source:">

The company's GPU Technology Conference (GTC) 2024 has begun, and investors are anticipating details on the GPUs based on its next-generation architecture, Blackwell. The stock's recent performance has made this year's GTC even more anticipated among investors. Analysts predict a moderate buy rating for Nvidia with an average twelve-month price prediction of $829.66.</p><p>Apart from Nvidia, there are two upcoming IPOs that also caught a lot of attention. SHEIN, the fast-fashion giant, has confidentially filed to go public in the U.S. The company was last valued at $66 billion and could be ready to start trading on the public markets as soon as 2024 Q2. However, SHEIN faces challenges related to labor practices and its environmental impact.</p><p>On the other hand, Reddit is closing in on a stock offering that could rank among the biggest U.S. IPOs so far this year. The social media company has set a price range of $31 to $34 a share. Despite revenue growth, Reddit faces profitability challenges and aims to boost ads.
Disclaimer: Investors should consider these factors and their own risk tolerance when evaluating these investment opportunities. As always, it's recommended to conduct thorough research or consult with a financial advisor before making investment decisions.</p><p>Sources:</p><ol><li><a href="https://quartr.com/insights/company-research/reddits-ipo-in-2024-a-closer-look-before-going-public-in-mar">https://quartr.com/insights/company-research/reddits-ipo-in-2024-a-closer-look-before-going-public-in-mar</a></li><li><a href="https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/NVDA/price-target/">https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/NVDA/price-target/</a></li><li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/27/shein-files-for-us-ipo-as-fast-fashion-giant-looks-to-expand-its-global-reach.html">https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/27/shein-files-for-us-ipo-as-fast-fashion-giant-looks-to-expand-its-global-reach.html</a></li><li><a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-jones-03-11-2024/card/reddit-ipo-how-the-company-s-own-wallstreetbet-stacks-up-0ykwE0P13PcFPHLNiC1a">https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-jones-03-11-2024/card/reddit-ipo-how-the-company-s-own-wallstreetbet-stacks-up-0ykwE0P13PcFPHLNiC1a</a></li><li><a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/what-will-2024-bring-for-nvidia-stock">https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/what-will-2024-bring-for-nvidia-stock</a></li></ol></x-accordion><x-accordion summary="The first Chinese cosmetic brand listed in NYSE:Yatsen"><p><em>Written by Erika Lau, 12/3/2024</em></p><p>Founded in 2017, Yatsen Holding Limited (NYSE: YSG) is a leading China-based beauty group. It operates various skincare and color cosmetics brands, including Galénic, DR.WU, Eve Lom, and Perfect Diary. Yatsen focuses on providing high-quality beauty products to consumers in China and internationally.</p><p>As of March 7th, 6:52 pm GMT, the stock price of YSG is $0.51 USD, reflecting a month-on-month decline of 18.9% and a year-on-year decline of 31.8%.
Yatsen has experienced both growth and challenges in its financial performance. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the company reported a 6.7% increase in total net revenues compared to the prior year period.</p><p>However, the company’s total net revenues for the full year of 2023 decreased by 7.9% compared to the previous year, indicating a potential slowdown in growth. Yatsen also reported a net loss of RMB 750.2 million (US$105.7 million) for the full year of 2023, which decreased by 8.7% compared to the prior year period. This was primarily due to significantly increased marketing expenses while sales volume remained weak. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2023, the company recorded a goodwill impairment, indicating that the carrying value of the Eve Lom reporting unit exceeded its fair value. This impairment was primarily attributed to weaker operating results than expected at the time of acquisition. Such impairments can negatively impact investor confidence and lead to a decline in the stock price.</p><p>In terms of past deals, Yatsen has focused on brand acquisition and geographical expansion. In 2020, the company acquired the beauty brand Little Ondine and the French skincare player Galenic. In 2021, it acquired the British premium skincare brand Eve Lom. In 2023, Yatsen’s jointly built factory with Cosmax Inc., a major cosmetics manufacturer in South Korea, began operations in Guangzhou, China.
Looking ahead, Yatsen aims to pursue sustainable growth through ongoing innovation across its brands. The company’s strategic plan includes brand repositioning, new product launches, and a focus on enhancing research and development capabilities. With the newly built factory, Yatsen is transitioning from an OEM to an ODM business model, which is expected to improve quality control and potentially lead to an increase in sales volume in future reporting periods.</p><p>Source:</p><ol><li><a href="https://ir.yatsenglobal.com/">Investors | Yatsen Group - Investor Relations Home</a></li><li><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/yatsen-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2023-financial-results-302081184.html">Yatsen Announces Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Results</a></li><li><a href="https://warburgpincus.com/investments/yatsen-global/">Yatsen Global - Warburg Pincus</a></li><li><a href="https://ir.yatsenglobal.com/2021-03-02-Yatsen-to-Acquire-Prestige-Skincare-Brand-Eve-Lom">Yatsen Global - News Release</a></li></ol></x-accordion><x-accordion summary="AI, Consumer Staples, Interest Rates &amp; Fixed Income, and Geographical Diversification"><p><em>Written by Jonathan Chen, 14/6/2024</em></p><p>U.S. Equities and AI: The technology sector, particularly companies involved in artificial intelligence (AI), remains a strong investment theme. The market has shown robust earnings growth expectations, with the tech sector expected to account for a significant portion of this growth. Companies like Nvidia, which has seen significant gains, are at the forefront. This trend is expected to continue as AI adoption broadens across various sectors</p><p>Consumer Staples: In an environment of persistent inflation, consumer staples stocks are seen as relatively resilient. These companies, which sell essential goods like food and basic consumer products, tend to perform well even when consumers cut back on non-essential purchases. Some of the top-performing consumer staples stocks include Costco, Walmart, and Procter &amp; Gamble</p><p>Interest Rates and Fixed Income: Central banks, including the Federal Reserve, have signaled potential rate cuts in the near future. This pivot could provide a favorable environment for bonds, particularly short-term bonds, as interest rates gradually decline. Investors may want to consider diversifying their fixed-income portfolios to include a mix of short- and intermediate-term bonds to mitigate reinvestment risk and capitalize on the potential for lower yields</p><p>Geographical Diversification: Beyond the U.S., Japan's stock market is gaining attention due to solid corporate earnings, favorable monetary policy, and economic reforms. Emerging markets like India and Mexico also present opportunities due to their growth potential and strategic positioning in global supply chains</p><p>Source:</p><ol><li>[https://www.edwardjones.com/us-en/market-news-insights/stock-market-news/stock-market-weekly-update]</li><li>[https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/insights/blackrock-investment-institute/outlook]</li><li>[https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/stock-market-outlook]</li></ol></x-accordion>
